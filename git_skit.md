_**MARK** calls **BEN** on his cell phone._

**MARK** (to **BEN**):_
>Hi Ben. Have you started working on our super-secret Python code to steal Colonel Sander’s recipe?

		BEN
Hi Mark. Yes I wrote a first draft in Python. I’ll email it to you so that you can add some diabolical code of your own.

MARK
Excellent…

BEN sends an email to MARK. MARK calls IAN on his cell phone.

		MARK
Hello Ian. What are you doing this afternoon? Would you like to steal Colonel Sander’s secret recipe?

IAN
I would love to steal the recipe. In fact I have some code which can help us hack into their computer system.

MARK
I knew I could count on you Dr. Ian. I will send you version 2 of the file so that you can add your code.

BEN calls MARK on his cell phone.

BEN
Hello Mark. I added some code to play the Mission Impossible theme song while we are executing our diabolical plan. I’ll email you an updated file called v1_edits.

MARK
Okay. That is a great plan.


BEN and MARK hang up.
MARK
Now Ian has the most updated version of the code. Think evil mastermind, think! I suppose I should send these updates to Ian.

MARK calls IAN.
MARK
Hello Ian.

IAN
Hello Mark.

MARK
I have some updates for the super secret code. Can you add them to the version of the file you are working on?

IAN
They had better be evil updates. I am working on version 3 right now.

MARK
Oh they most certainly are…

IAN
Okay I will add them.

MARK and IAN hang up.

IAN
How to add these updates to version 3? I have to sort through the entire file and find the lines that were updated.
	IAN sighs.
Being this evil sure ain’t easy.


IAN calls MARK.

IAN
Hello Mark. I emailed you version 4 of the super secret code. I added the edits that you requested.

MARK
Oh no… I just finished editing version 2. Ian can you also add my updates to the super secret code?


IAN
IAN groans.
Mark I will do this because I really want to get that secret recipe.


IAN and MARK hang up.

IAN
I have the worst job in this entire criminal organization! I don’t even know which lines Mark edited. This is terrible! I quit! I am going to start my own rival criminal organization and steal the recipe myself!
