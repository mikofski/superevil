# Git Skit

by Ben Johnson


_MARK calls BEN on his cell phone._

**MARK** (to **BEN**)
>Hi Ben. Have you started working on our super-secret Python code to steal Colonel Sander’s recipe?

**BEN**
>Hi Mark. Yes I wrote a first draft in Python. I’ll email it to you so that you can add some diabolical code of your own.

**MARK**
>Excellent…

_BEN sends an email to MARK. MARK calls IAN on his cell phone._

**MARK**
>Hello Ian. What are you doing this afternoon? Would you like to steal Colonel Sander’s secret recipe?

**IAN**
>I would love to steal the recipe. In fact I have some code which can help us hack into their computer system.

**MARK**
>I knew I could count on you Dr. Ian. I will send you version 2 of the file so that you can add your code.

_BEN calls MARK on his cell phone._

**BEN**
>Hello Mark. I added some code to play the Mission Impossible theme song while we are executing our diabolical plan. I’ll email you an updated file called v1_edits.

**MARK**
>Okay. That is a great plan.

_BEN and MARK hang up._

**MARK**
>Now Ian has the most updated version of the code. Think evil mastermind, think! I suppose I should send these updates to Ian.

_MARK calls IAN._

**MARK**
>Hello Ian.

**IAN**
>Hello Mark.

**MARK**
>I have some updates for the super secret code. Can you add them to the version of the file you are working on?

**IAN**
>They had better be evil updates. I am working on version 3 right now.

**MARK**
>Oh they most certainly are…

**IAN**
>Okay I will add them.

_MARK and IAN hang up._

**IAN**
>How to add these updates to version 3? I have to sort through the entire file and find the lines that were updated.

_IAN sighs._
>Being this evil sure ain’t easy.


_IAN calls MARK._

**IAN**
>Hello Mark. I emailed you version 4 of the super secret code. I added the edits that you requested.

**MARK**
>Oh no… I just finished editing version 2. Ian can you also add my updates to the super secret code? Thanks!  You're awesome.

_IAN groans._

**IAN**
>Mark I will do this because I really want to get that secret recipe.

_IAN and MARK hang up._

**IAN**
>I have the worst job in this entire criminal organization! I don’t even know which lines Mark edited. This is terrible! I quit! I am going to start my own rival criminal organization and steal the recipe myself!
